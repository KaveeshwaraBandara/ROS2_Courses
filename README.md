# ROS Courses Workspace

A multi-course ROS 2 workspace with three separate course directories. Each course is a self-contained colcon workspace with its own `src/`, and generated `build/`, `install/`, and `log/` directories.

## Table of Contents

- [ROS2 for Beginners Level2: TF, URDF, RViz, Gazebo](ROS2_for_Beginners_Level2_TF_URDF_RVIZ_GAZEBO/README.md)
- [ROS2 Level3: Advanced Concepts](ROS2_Level3_Advanced_Concept/README.md)
- [ROS2 Nav2 with SLAM and Navigation](ROS2_Nav2_with_SLAM_and_Navigation/README.md)

## Courses

| Course folder | Focus | Highlights |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ROS2_for_Beginners_Level2_TF_URDF_RVIZ_GAZEBO` | TF, URDF, RViz, Gazebo | Robot description (URDF/Xacro), Gazebo world, RViz config, bringup launch files |
| `ROS2_Level3_Advanced_Concept` | Advanced ROS 2 concepts | Actions (C++/Python), lifecycle nodes (C++/Python), custom interfaces |
| `ROS2_Nav2_with_SLAM_and_Navigation` | Nav2/SLAM course workspace | Robot description with lidar, Gazebo world, bringup launch files |

## Repo Layout

- Each course folder is a separate ROS 2 workspace.
- Source code lives under `src/` in each course.
- `build/`, `install/`, and `log/` are generated by colcon and can be removed and rebuilt.

## Common Workflow (Per Course)

```bash
cd <course_folder>
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```

Launch files are under `src/**/launch/`. Inspect them to choose what to run for each course.

## Notes

- This repo contains multiple workspaces; build and source them independently.
- If you want a clean rebuild, you can remove `build/`, `install/`, and `log/` in a course folder.
